# Vivere - Strive to live

### a calorie tracking app (think MyFitnessPal) built with Ionic & Node

---

#### CSC498x - Mobile App Development Final Project

---

## Requirements (or at least what works for me)

-   Node v16.4.0
-   npm 7.18.1
-   ionic 6.18.1

## How to Run

### Client

```
cd client && npm install && ionic lab
```

### Server

```
cd server && npm install && npm start
```

Server is already hosted over at [api-vivere.herokuapp.com](https://api-vivere.herokuapp.com/) and the client is configured to send requests to that server so there is no need to run the server just to demo the app.

### Database

Database is currently being hosted over at MongoDB Cloud and is 90MBs+ (because of _**500,000+**_ food items!), and as such it is not stored within this repository.

Contact me if you'd like me to email you the database dump and/or walk you through the collections over zoom.
